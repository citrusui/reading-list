nTopology provides software to generate complex lattices, perfect for use in 3D printing projects. 

A lattice is a complex structure that resembles a scaffold. If engineered correctly, it can provide reasonable strength with a minimum of material used, something rather important for 3D printing. 

A complex lattice is something relatively new in the field of making, as the tooling of years ago was unable to physically produce anything more than just basic lattice elements. Today's lattices are typically generated by software as their complexity is far beyond anything that could be done manually. 

That software is what we're talking about today. Specifically, the tools offered by nTopology, a company dedicated to providing lattice generating software for 3D printing. 

"Element", their Windows-based tool, permits easy generation of internal lattice structures that when 3D printed could provide far lighter parts that still retain sufficient strength for their intended application. 

Starting with a solid shape, Element carves out the interior and replaces it with a lattice designed around parameters you specify. From there you can do things like thickening the spars, for example. This video shows briefly how it can work:
