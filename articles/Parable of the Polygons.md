# [Parable of the Polygons](undefined)

**This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world.**

These little cuties are 50% Triangles, 50% Squares, and 100% slightly shapist.
But only slightly!
In fact, every polygon _prefers_ being in a diverse crowd:

You can only move them if they're unhappy with their immediate neighborhood.
Once they're OK where they are, _you can't move them until they're unhappy with their neighbors again_.
They've got one, simple rule:

**"I wanna move if less than 1/3 of my neighbors are like me."
**

Harmless, right?
Every polygon would be happy with a mixed neighborhood.
Surely their small bias can't affect the larger shape society that much?
Well...

drag...
