Another interesting benefit of this approach is that enclosed cavities need not be filled with unfused metal powder, as would be the case with powder-bed machines. Imagine an interior sparse structure, as often done with plastic 3D prints, where the weight of the part is decreased yet its strength is maintained through an ingenious interior structure. 

In a powder bed approach, this cavity would remain filled with expensive metal powder unless specific design steps were taken to remove the powder. For example, drain holes might be required, through which you might be able to shake out any residual powder - at possibly USD$500 per kg. 

This video shows the technology in action and explains more about how the deposition technology works.
