    Facebook Live Studio with Ray and Amy Kurzweil at SXSW. Cartoonist and author Amy (daughter of Ray Kurzweil) Kurzweil Comix, and author, futurist, and inventor Ray Kurzweil.   
  
Ray Kurzweil highlighted three big things:   
- we have to continue to predict change  
- the singularity will happen by 2029  
- humans merging with AI will only make us better.   
  
Ray predicts by the 2030s we will connect our neocortex, the part of our brain where we do our thinking, to the cloud.
