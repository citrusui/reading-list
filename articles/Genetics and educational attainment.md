    Heritability is a population parameter that can be estimated using different experimental designs. Until technological advances facilitated the direct measurement of DNA variants, the heritabilities of various humans were mostly estimated by comparing the resemblance of twins, adoptees, and other pairs of relatives.

To explain heritability, a simple and highly stylized causal model is useful; our treatment follows Benjamin _et al._[6][0] We assume the genetic variants influencing the outcome of questions are located at _J_ separate locations ("loci") in the genome. At each locus, individuals are endowed with two alleles, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. We can arbitrarily designate one of these to be the reference allele, and define person _i_'s genotype at locus _j_, _x_
_ij_
, by the number of reference alleles person _i_ is endowed with (because we make the simplifying assumption of only two alleles, this number is always equal to 0,1 or 2).

We assume the following causal model for person _i_'s outcome:

where _j_ indexes the loci, _β_
_j_
is the causal impact of an additional copy of the reference allele at locus _j_ (this impact need not be the same across time and space), and _U_
_i_
is an environmental variable. If _Y_
_i_
is normalized so its standard deviation is 1, and _G_
_i_
and _U_
_i_
are uncorrelated, the total variance in _Y_
_i_
is the sum of two components: a genetic factor (_h_2≡_var_(_G_
_i_
)) and a non-genetic factor (_u_2≡_var_(_U_
_i_
)). The parameter _h_2---known as (narrow sense) heritability---is simply the _R_2 from the population regression of the outcome on the _J_ genotypes.

One can make inferences about the _h_2 of a trait without knowing the specific genes responsible for the heritable variation. Prior to the widespread availability of molecular data, most such efforts have relied on comparisons of the resemblance in the observable characteristics ("phenotypes") of various pairings of relatives who vary in their degree of environmental and genetic resemblance. In these studies, a commonly made assumption is that the distributions of _G_
_i_
and _U_
_i_
are the same across all types of siblings. Randomly ordering the two members of a sibling pair and denoting the second member of a pair by a prime, most heritability estimates are based on identifying conditions that have the general form:

On the left-hand side of Eq. [2][1] is the phenotypic correlation, whose sample analog is easily estimated by drawing a random sample of sibling pairs of type k and calculating the pairwise correlation between their outcomes. The methodology of studies in "behavior genetics" is fundamentally about using estimated phenotypic correlations for various types of siblings to infer population parameters such as _h_2 and _u_2. In general, assumptions about are often based on population genetic theory,
