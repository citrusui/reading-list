# [Spacex scheduled relaunch of a recovered booster is scheduled for this Thursday](undefined)

    <<<[SpaceX is now targeting 6 p.m. Thursday for its first re-launch of a used Falcon 9 rocket booster, a mission that aims to loft a commercial communications satellite to orbit from Kennedy Space Center.][0]  
  
Launch teams on Monday aimed to fuel the two-stage rocket during a practice countdown culminating in a short test-firing of nine Merlin main engines at Launch Complex 39A.  
  
Delays completing the test over the weekend pushed a planned Wednesday launch of the SES-10 satellite back a day.  
  
There's a 70 percent chance of acceptable weather during the window, according to the Air Force's 45th Weather Squadron. The odds drop slightly to 60 percent
