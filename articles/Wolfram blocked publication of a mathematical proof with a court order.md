The **Rule 110 cellular automaton** (often simply **Rule 110**) is an [elementary cellular automaton][0] with interesting behavior on the boundary between stability and chaos. In this respect it is similar to [Conway's Game of Life][1]. Also like Life, Rule 110 is known to be [Turing complete][2]. This implies that, in principle, any calculation or computer program can be simulated using this automaton.
