# Flex

The Flex group uses technology to improve the range and fluidity of human expression. We invent new concepts and representations that amplify people's ability to create, connect, and understand. We create tools that blur the line between using and creating, in order to provide a conversational medium for thinking and doing.

We are part of [HARC][0] at [Y Combinator Research][1].

## People

## Projects

### Ohm

[Ohm][2] is a parser generator and toolkit for quickly building parsers, compilers, and interpreters for new programming languages. Unlike many similar tools, Ohm is strongly focused on the developer experience. It has been used in several Flex research projects ([Chorus][3], [Seymour][4], MUD, Konnakkol) and has been taught in programming language courses at UCLA and [Loyola Marymount University][5].

The [Ohm Editor][6] is a live programming environment for authoring Ohm grammars in the browser. Its central feature is a novel visualization that shows every step of the parsing process, helping the user understand how a given input was parsed (or why it failed).

### Seymour

Seymour is a new programming language and environment that enables programmers to better see and understand the execution of their programs. We are creating an introductory programming course around this tool, and expect that it will help students build a deeper understanding of programming and develop powerful ways of thinking about computation.

### Chorus

![](https://harc.ycr.org/flex/images/chorus.png)

The [Chorus project][7] is exploring the middle ground between spreadsheets and programming. Current programming technology demands great expertise, discouraging the creation of a vast range of simple software applications. It need not be so. We take hope from pre-internet products like VisualBasic and HyperCard that brought programming to many non-experts. We want to pick up where those forerunners left off and make modern internet application programming almost as easy as using a spreadsheet. To achieve that goal we are willing to sacrifice power, compatibility, performance, and even the sacred traditions of programming culture. We are focusing first on mobile social apps: simple cloud applications running on phones that organize groups, for example a book club, a soccer league, or an office workflow. Our modest strategy is to develop a product with unique value to non-programmers that is a viral vector for a dramatically simplified programming experience.
