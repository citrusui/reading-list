# [Netlify CMS â€“ An open-source CMS for Git workflows](https://www.netlifycms.org/)

    # Our Inspiration

Netlify CMS is part of a long evolution in content management for the web. Even in the budding realm of the [JAMstack][0] and [static site generators][1], developers have a variety ["headless" CMS][2] options to choose from.

Proprietary services like Contentful and DatoCMS provide the ease and polish of a concierge provider, while simple open source projects like Prose and Google Drive CMS provide targeted functionality for limited use cases. We love that these other projects help advance the modern web, and we believe there will always be a place for them in the JAMstack ecosystem.

With Netlify CMS, we hope to carve a different niche. We aim to do for the JAMstack what WordPress did for dynamic sites back in the day. In other words, we want to build a CMS that is open-source but fully-featured and production-ready, that's as easy to customize as it is to use, and that developers and content editors can build a community around.

[Help us make it happen!][3]
